I am eagerly revising my programming abilities. 
The program is based on code from this tutorial https://www.javatpoint.com/java-jtextfield, 
but I have greatly deviated from the tutorial so that the program has more features, is more robust, and so that the code's structure tidier.

I did not passively copy the tutorial. Instead I actively experimented with it's contents in order to really understand what I was typing.
